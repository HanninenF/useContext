TRY USING AI AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE.

ALL CODE FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT IS ALREADY IN THE CODE.

YOU CAN FIGURE THIS OUT!

TODO:S

Add more inputs to the student form.
Add a delete function in global state using the existing provider.

The cards needs some work, we want to be able to assign styles to each input value we have i.e name, lastname and so on.
Change the behaviour of the container or parent of the cards so it can hold 4 cards side by side, then after 4 it should automatically 
jump down to a new row.

Can we make a card "expand" on click ?
And if so, can we then add some more features there?  
As of now the card image is hardcoded, think of a way we can change that, maybe put a bunch of images into an array then using a dropdown to choose an image? 

Also fiddle with the design as a whole, change position of the the form.
Change colors, fonts, borders, sizes and so on.

Make it yours!

Please Observe!
THIS IS USING TAILWIND!


Have fun!
